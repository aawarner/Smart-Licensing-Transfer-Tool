#### **SLT Process Workflow**
The process workflow assumes the customer already has created a Smart Account (with associated Virtual Accounts) and licenses deposited to the "DEFAULT" VA. The workflow steps are:

#### **Requirements**
Python 3 with these packages:
* json
* os
* sys
* request

#### **Step-by-Step Setup & Operation**

1.) Request API access and register SLT Application - Follow the [Request API Access Guide](https://apidocs-prod.cisco.com/?path=requestapiinfo)
    
* Ensure "Client Credentials Grant" & "Resource Owner Grant" is selected
* Copy "client_id" and "client_secret" credentials and store in a **safe** location

2.) Install Python 3 and required packages. See [Requirements](#requirements)

3.) Clone the BLT repository from Github/DEVNET

4.) Setup local Python environment 

* Ensure the "creds.json" file contains the "client_id" and "client_secret" is the correct format
```
   creds.json Format
   
{"client_id": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx", "client_secret": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"}
```
* Ensure Python "Environment Variables" for USERNAME= AND PASSWORD= are set in the IDE

5.) Run the Python script to transfer licenses as needed. 
```
python SL-Pull-Token-Transfer-Licenses-Between-VAs.py
```

*Note, the script references the "licenses.json" for bulk transfers first. If the file is not present, the script prompts the user for input.
```
